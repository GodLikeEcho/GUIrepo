There are currently no bugs since this project is still in the design phase. The current goal of the project is to get the entire UI layed out by the end of the term. It will not be pulling from the database, but the buttons will be clickable and all functions should be visiable and working with dummy information.

<br>**Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives**<br>
The idea for this project came about while searching for a food cart for about an hour. the location information us out of fate on their website and we had to hear from a random friend that it had moved to another parking lot. While talking about it with my family they brought up the point that this could be a great app to solve the problem.
